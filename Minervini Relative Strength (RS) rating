1. Select the time periods for return calculation: common periods are 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months.

2. Calculate the rate of change (ROC) for the stock price over each period. For example:
   - 12-month ROC = (Current Price / Price 12 months ago) - 1
   - 6-month ROC = (Current Price / Price 6 months ago) - 1
   - 3-month ROC = (Current Price / Price 3 months ago) - 1
   - 1-month ROC = (Current Price / Price 1 month ago) - 1

3. Assign weights to each ROC period to emphasize more recent performance. For example:
   - 12-month ROC weight: 1
   - 6-month ROC weight: 2
   - 3-month ROC weight: 3
   - 1-month ROC weight: 4

4. Calculate the weighted sum of ROCs:
   $$
   \text{Total ROC} = (12m\ ROC \times 1) + (6m\ ROC \times 2) + (3m\ ROC \times 3) + (1m\ ROC \times 4)
   $$

5. Calculate the Total ROC for all stocks in the universe.

6. Rank all stocks by their Total ROC from highest to lowest.

7. Calculate RS Rating for a stock as its percentile rank:
   $$
   RS\ Rating = \frac{\text{Position in ROC ranked list}}{\text{Total number of stocks}} \times 100
   $$

   This means a stock with RS Rating of 90 has outperformed 90% of the stocks.

This RS Rating is used as a score from 1 to 99 indicating how strong a stock is compared to others, based on price momentum across multiple key time frames. Traders like Mark Minervini use this RS Rating along with other criteria to identify leading stocks.

Example:

- Assume for stock XYZ:
  - 12-month ROC = 50%
  - 6-month ROC = 30%
  - 3-month ROC = 20%
  - 1-month ROC = 10%

- Weighted Total ROC:
  $$
  50\%\times 1 + 30\%\times 2 + 20\%\times 3 + 10\%\times 4 = 0.5 + 0.6 + 0.6 + 0.4 = 2.1
  $$

- Comparing 2.1 among all stocks, suppose it ranks 50th in a universe of 500 stocks.

- RS Rating:
  $$
  (500 - 50 + 1) / 500 \times 100 = 90.2
  $$
 
So, XYZ has an RS Rating of about 90, meaning it outperforms roughly 90% of stocks.

This stepwise method captures Minervini's RS calculation concept for stock screening and momentum analysis.
